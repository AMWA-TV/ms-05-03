# Signal paths

Most media devices are fundamentally concerned with audio/video signal storage, processing, and/or forwarding. To describe these functions, NCA defines the concept of `signal paths` between control objects. In addition to containing a set of control objects, a block may optionally define the signal paths among those objects.

Signal paths are properties of the `NcBlock` class as described in [MS-05-02 NMOS Control Framework](https://specs.amwa.tv/ms-05-02).
