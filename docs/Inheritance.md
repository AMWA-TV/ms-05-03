# Inheritance

A blockspec may be defined as a specialized version of another blockspec. This mechanism is called `blockspec inheritance`. The blockspec from which a given blockspec inherits is called the `parent`.

Details of the parent `blockspec` id and version are captured by specific properties inside the `NcBlock` control object as described in [MS-05-02 NMOS Control Framework](https://specs.amwa.tv/ms-05-02).
